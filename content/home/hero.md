We aim at finding signals of physics beyond the Standard Model using a
wide range of astrophysical observations.  Our ultimate goal is to shed light
on dark matter and other mysteries of the dark Universe.  We focus on new
observational approaches and technical challenges that others have not been
able to overcome.  An important component is to train the next generation of
astroparticle physicists in cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
