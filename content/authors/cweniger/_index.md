# Christoph Weniger

I am an associate professor at GRAPPA, the center of excellence for GRavitation AstroParticle Physics Amsterdam, and the Institute of Physics at the
University of Amsterdam.  Currently, I lead as Principle Investigator the ERC consolidator
project `UnDark`.  I use Machine Learning to shed light on the mysteries of the
dark Universe.
